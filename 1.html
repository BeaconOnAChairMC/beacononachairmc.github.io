<p> Hi. </p>


<br>

<p> If you are reading this, then welcome! You are starting chapter one of, uh, random things that crossed my mind! </p>

<p> Well, of course they aren't random. Is anything really random in this world? Is there something called free will? </p>

<p> Oh well, we are getting off the topic. Yes, I am going to use this website to write random things that I have thought of. </p>

<br>

<p> For starters, let's start with some really small thing. </p>

<p> If everyone bought a stock on the stock market, let the price of that stock go up rapidly, and then sold all the stock at the same time, would that work? </p>
<p> I don't know. This is probably impossible to begin with. </p>
<p> I know next to nothing about the stock market. It always intrigued me, though. </p>
<p> What is the stock market? Do I steal money from others? If I make a profit, do others lose money? </p>
<p> For every dollar I earn on the stock market, does someone else lose a dollar?</p>
<br>
<p> Well surely everyone can't benefit from the stock market. Or else, that'd just be infinite money. And the inflation would be... uhh </p>
<p> A <i>little</i> undesirable.</p>

<br>
<p> Enough about the stock market. The stock market can sort itself out. Those Redditors apparently stole lots of money from a hedge fund or whatever. </p>
<p> That was like, what, a few months ago? I really don't even know. </p>

<p> I'm probably gonna leave it here, because I'm getting a bit tired. Sorry if it wasn't interesting, but there's nothing you can do about it is there? </p>
