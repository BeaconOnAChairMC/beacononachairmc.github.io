<p> Some people might call this a horrible website. Some people might criticize it.</p>

<br><br>

<p> Maybe they want to see a website they've always been seeing, the ones with the fancy CSS and the fancy Javascript.</p>

<br>

<p> Well I'm not here to give you any of that bullsh*t. I'm here to give you text. </p>

<p> Lots and lots of it. </p>

<br>

<p> Sometimes we see a website, and go "Oh wow! That is such a great website!"</p>
<p> That would be the normal reaction to something that looks great.</p>
<p> Sometimes, however, we forget that the website is slow, cluttered and doesn't do the thing you want it to do. </p>
<p> What's the point of a website if the design is overshadowing the content? </p>
<p> What's the point of a website if the huge, fancy buttons are limiting the functionality of the website? </p>

<br><br>

<p> Well, not anymore. This website only uses paragraphs.</p>
<p> There isn't a single line of CSS, Javascript or even divs in this website. </p>
<p> This provides you with exactly what you wanted from it: something to read. </p>
<p> Of course, if you didn't want to read anything, then just leave. Go. </p>
<p> If you want to read something, stay I guess. </p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p> A website is like a piece of land to me. Or a building. Or a house.</p>
<p> In this vast space on the internet, I get to own something. I get to have something that I can claim is mine (if I remember to pay, of course). </p>
<p> If I were running some business or something, I'd probably want this website to be more user-friendly. </p>
<p> I'd probably make it more attractive, and more functional. </p>
<p> Unfortunately for those of you who are reading this, I'm not running some business. </p>
<p> This website is mine, and it will stay mine (I hope). </p>
<p> And in this small piece of the internet I have to myself, I am going to write random things that cross my mind. </p>
<p> It's a blog of sorts. But it's not really a blog. Is it? Perhaps it is. Maybe it's not.</p>
